# TODO



Combine breadcrubms and apptoolbar into actionbar


Fix remove item context menu
Add New project, new task context menu


Add details pane to current Project in header view
Goal: every view could stand on its own. 
It should be added as a child by its parent

1. When selecting an item in the SummaryView, it re-renders, and thus scrolls to the top. Irritating. Maybe make it so that selecting only updates the detail view.
2. Get rid of the clunky double click sensor


Move logic for taskSummaryViews and projectSummaryView to their classes from 


ProjectPageView
   HeaderView
      BreadCrumbs
      AppToolbar
   ContentView
      SummaryView
         SummaryContents
            Toolbar
            TaskSummaryView(s)
            ProjectSummaryView(s)
      DetailsView
   FooterView
